      * Conceptualized and built the natural language to code feature for the Power Query M language, used for wrangling tables in Excel, Fabric and PowerBI.
      * Collaborated towards building the Copilot experience as a part of the Power Query experience in Fabric and Excel.
      * Devised two state-of-the-art strategies TSTR (EMNLP-Findings 2023) and COOPER (Under submission to ASE 2024) for optimal dynamic prompt construction aiding in-context learning for natural language to code tasks.
      * Developed Alternate Task Technique (ATT) (Under submission COLM, 2024), a generalized framework to post-process LLM outputs using alternate tasks that improved performance on low resource languages, like Power Query M, by 13%.
      * Developed Adapted Dense Retrieval (ADDER) (Submitted to CIKM, 2024) framework for Information Retrieval tasks using dense embedding for efficient code retrieval in low-resource settings.
