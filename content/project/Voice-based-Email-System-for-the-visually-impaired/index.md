Visual impairment, also known as vision impairment or vision loss, is a decreased ability to see to a degree that causes problems not fixable by usual means, such as glasses.

Although there are many screen readers available then also these people face some minor difficulties.

We have come up with this project in which we will be developing a voice based email system which will aid the visually impaired people who are naive to computer systems to use email facilities in a hassle free manner. 

We use:

1. STT (Speech-to-text): here whatever we speak is converted to text.
2. Text to speech synthesizer which converts the text format of the emails to synthesized speech.
3. IVR (Interactive voice response): allows user to interact with an email host system via voice request, after that users can easily service their own enquiries by listening to the IVR dialogue.

When using this system the computer will be prompting the user to perform specific operations to avail respective services.
